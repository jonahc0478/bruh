		<!-- A bit about me -->

		<p>Hello, my name is <ins>Jonah Catlin,</ins> and I am a student at <strong>NCSU.</strong>  
		I am planning on majoring in some sort of <em>engineering discipline,</em> 
		but I have <ins>not decided</ins> which one yet.</p>    
		
		<p>My favorite <del>element</del> molecule is H<sub>2</sub>O, since without it I would literally die.  
		My <del>favorite</del> <strong>least favorite</strong> math problem from this semester was finding 
		a particular solution to the equation<br/>
		<em>y<sup>"</sup> + 9y = 4t<sup>3</sup>sin(3t),</em><br/>
		since I was just supposed to find the <strong>form</strong> of the solution, and I used like an <ins>entire page</ins> 
		of math notebook evaluating coefficients that I <strong>didn't need to be evaluating,</strong> 
		when I only needed <ins>one line of paper.</ins> >:|
		</p>
